# [neatest](https://github.com/rtmigo/neatest_py)

Runs unit tests with standard Python `unittest` module.

Automates test discovery.

Can be conveniently invoked from Python code as `neatest.run(...)` method
instead of running `python -m unittest discover ...` in shell.

# Install

``` bash
pip3 install neatest
```

# Project layout

`neatest` discovers all classes inherited from `unittest.TestCase` within the
project. Test cases can be placed in **any .py file** inside **any directory**.
If you prefer to keep test cases in the "tests" directory with filenames
starting with "test", they will be discovered, because they are also "any
files in any directory".

You can use a simple project layout:

```
my_simple_project
    __init__.py     # tests can be placed here
    test_a.py       # tests can be placed here
    test_b.py       # tests can be placed here
    anything.py     # tests can be placed here
```

or a project with multiple packages:

```
my_complex_project
    package_a
        __init__.py         # tests can be placed here
        any_files.py        # tests can be placed here
        can_contain.py      # tests can be placed here
        tests_inside.py     # tests can be placed here
        ...
    package_b
        __init__.py         # tests can be placed here
        ...
    tests  
        __init__.py         # tests can be placed here
        test_something.py   # tests can be placed here
        test_anything.py    # tests can be placed here        
```

Directories must be **importable** as packages from the project directory.

They are importable, when you can

``` bash
$ cd my_complex_project
$ python3 
```

and then in Python

``` python3
import package_a
import package_b
import tests 
```

# Run

## Run tests from terminal

``` bash
$ cd my_complex_project
$ neatest
```

```
Package "package_a" contains 3 tests
Package "package_b" contains 4 tests
Package "tests" contains 16 tests
.....
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 23 tests in 2.947s

OK
```

Add some command line options:

``` bash
$ cd my_complex_project
$ neatest -r requests -r lxml --warnings fail
```

## Run tests from .py script

#### Create run_tests.py

``` python3
import neatest
neatest.run()
```

#### Run command

``` bash
$ cd my_complex_project
$ python3 path/to/run_tests.py
```

The idea behind creating a script is to eliminate the need to create other
`.sh`, `.bat` or config files for the testing. All the information you need to
run tests is contained in single executable `.py` file. It is short and portable
as the Python itself.

``` python3
import neatest
neatest.run(tests_require=['requests', 'lxml'],
            warnings=neatest.Warnings.fail)
```



# Test discovery

## Filenames

`neatest` searches for tests in all `*.py` files.

The same can be achieved with standard `unittest` like this:

``` bash
$ python3 -m unittest discover -p "*.py"
```

## Directories

`neatest` assumes, that the current directory is the project directory. It is
the base directory for all imports.

If the `start_directory` are not specified, `neatest` will find all the packages
inside the project directory and will run tests for each of them.

```
my_project
    package_a               # tests in package_a will be discovered
        __init__.py
    package_b               # tests in package_b will be discovered
        __init__.py
    package_c               # tests in package_c will be discovered
        __init__.py
        subpackage          # subpackage is a part of package_c 
            __init__.py     # so tests will be discovered
            ...
    subdir                  # subdir is not a package
        package_d           # tests in package_d will NOT be discovered  
            __init__.py     # because it is not importable    
  setup.py
```

So running

``` bash
$ cd my_project
$ neatest
```

will perform the same tests as

``` bash
$ cd my_project
$ python3 -m unittest discover -t . -s package_a -p "*.py"
$ python3 -m unittest discover -t . -s package_b -p "*.py"
$ python3 -m unittest discover -t . -s package_c -p "*.py"
```
